        Each of us is made up of a combination of the elements: ether (space), air, fire, water and earth. Our individual bodily make-up, or constitution, when honored allows us to live in harmony and serenity. The five elements then pair-up into three combinations
        (known as doshas) to form the primary forces of nature.
        <br>
        <br>
        Each of us carry our own unique dosha that is established at time of birth. This is known as our prakriti. Our current constitution, known as our vikriti, has the ability to change while prakriti does not. Life influences (such as diet, environmental
        factors, lifestyle, etc.) cause vikriti to move out of balance from our prakriti, shifting us out of harmony. In excess this can lead to disease. Ayurveda strives to keep us in a state of serenity and out of a state of stress.

        <h6>The 3 Doshas: Vata | Pitta | Kapha</h6>
        <p>Ayurveda states that each of us is born with a unique combination of elemental energies, called doshas. Our dosha is derived from a combination of the five great elements: ether, air, fire, water and earth. The doshic combination we are born with
            (our prakriti - see “What is Ayurveda“) stays with us throughout our lifetime, while our current state of being (vikriti) may be swayed away from our original nature by outside factors.</p>
        <p>All of us embody all three doshas, while maintaining a dominant (or dual-dominant) dosha. Keeping our original doshic nature in balance allows us to experience life in a harmonious state. The three doshas are Vata, Pitta and Kapha.</p>
